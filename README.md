# sports-watching
A project started to test the feasibility of NHL sports games feed tracking to know what parts of games to watch.

## Purpose of the project
These days I find myself more and more concerned with how I am spending my time. When watching sports like an NHL hockey game I find myself feeling like much of the time goes to waste. The main causes of this are:
- Ads
- In between whistles
- Portions of the game where nothing interesting happens
- Watching a game where my team played terrible and getting no enjoyment

## What am I trying to build
I am aiming to build an application that will utilize some NHL event APIs for a game my team played and present me with some insights:
- Would I enjoy this game, i.e. excitment factor (specifics elsewhere)
- What parts of the game would I enjoy (time-on-clock)
It also might summarize the other parts of the game that I am skipping through via text to get get that holistic sense of the game still.

I also imagine I might want to dynamically change the amount of time I watch a game based off of:
- How much time I have that day
- How much excitement value the game has

### Why not just watch the highlights
I find the highlights often don't give a very good sense of the game due to having to include points from all through periods, picking up in the middle of the play, and often showing boring parts anyway. I am trying this partially to see if it is any more enjoyable for me as a fan relative to highlights.
